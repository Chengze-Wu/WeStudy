# WeStudy App
Anroid collaberative focus App written in Java.
# Summary
WeStudy is an App that allows users to invite friends to supervise each other's study and share their learning results. The App uses Objrct Oriented Programming to create classes, instantiate objects and cleanly modularize the code. And uses the Firebase database to store user following and chat information.  

Unfortunately, due to time limit, I was not able to further develop the software to the desired result. I will continue to learn and continue the development of this software in the future.
